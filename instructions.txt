# This pipeline is working with the github repo
# https://github.com/exklinxence/simple-web

# i forked the sample project and added my kubernetes and jenkins scripts
# i could also create another repo for kubernetes and jenkins scripts but i feel this is a small project

### STEP 1
# the following plugins to jenkins
# 1. <Docker Pipeline>   version 1.26

# this pipeline assumes your machine is a linux distro and the following
# please use your dockerhub username to name your image
# you have a running kubernetes cluster
# you have a working docker hub profile
# you have created your docker login credentials on jenkins
# you can use the link to add your docker login credential to jenkins
# assuming you are running jenkins on port 8080
# host_url:8080/credentials/store/domain/_/newCredentials
# i created mine and named it dockerhublogincredential

# create kubernetes credentials and name it kubenetes
# copy the content of your kubernetes config file mine is at ~/.kube/config
# select enter manually and paste the value of your kubernetes config file


### STEP 2
# Create a new Pipeline Job give it a name of your choice
